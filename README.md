Little CLI tool I'm writing to distract myself from how miserable I feel right now. Idk if code is the healthiest coping mechanism, but at least I'm not like doing drugs or something idk. Accidentally took two of my mood stabilizers today and I still feel like shit. I'd be working on crafting interpreters but I don't have the motivation to rn. Ok done ranting have fun with this I guess
